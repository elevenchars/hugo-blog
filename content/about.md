My name is Will Ingarfield. I am a student at UT Dallas pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics. I am interested in data science, competitive programming, procedural generation, cryptography, and cybersecurity. I plan to use this website as a place to post small writeups on projects I am working on.

I am actively looking for internships for Summer 2019. Feel free to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-ingarfield-a0326a159/) or [email me](mailto:will.ingarfield@gmail.com).
