			<description>I figured it might be useful to post some quick notes on how I set this site up. When I was looking for tools to use, I wanted a low maintenance static site generator that did not require a lot of web design knowledge. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of how Hugo works so I decided to give it a shot with Netlify.

<p>I figured it might be useful to post some quick notes on how I set this site up. When I was looking for tools to use, I wanted a low maintenance static site generator that did not require a lot of web design knowledge. I&rsquo;m a big fan of how Hugo works so I decided to give it a shot with Netlify.</p>

<h2 id="creating-your-first-site">Creating your first site</h2>

<p>For this I pretty much followed the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/" target="_blank">Hugo quickstart</a> exactly. It&rsquo;s important to check if your theme has an example <code>config.toml</code> because often themes will have custom parameters in this. I decided to make my theme a submodule of my blog repo because I am (probably) the only one who is going to be maintaining this site so simple cloning is not a concern to me. I would look more into <code>git subtree</code> or simply cloning the theme repo if your site is going to be maintained by multiple people.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-to-netlify">Deploying to Netlify</h2>

<p>This was honestly the easiest part of the process and something I was very impressed by. Once I had committed my site repo to Github it was just a few clicks to get it deployed on Netlify. Make sure that your <code>HUGO_VERSION</code> environment variable is set to something somewhat recent. If you are using a theme that requires <a href="https://gohugo.io/news/0.43-relnotes/" target="_blank">Hugo Extended</a> (read: SASS/SCSS support) to build, make sure that the <code>resources/_gen/assets</code> directory is being tracked in your repo so that the Netlify build will skip the asset generation steps. This may be fixed in a newer version of Netlify. (<a href="https://github.com/netlify/build-image/issues/182" target="_blank">See here</a>)</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m really impressed by how easy this was to set up. It has been mostly hands free on my part and I plan to use this setup for future static site projects.</p>
