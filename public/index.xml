      <description>I figured it might be useful to post some quick notes on how I set this site up. When I was looking for tools to use, I wanted a low maintenance static site generator that did not require a lot of web design knowledge. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of how Hugo works so I decided to give it a shot with Netlify.
Creating your first site For this I pretty much followed the Hugo quickstart exactly.</description>

      <description>My name is Will Ingarfield. I am a student at UT Dallas pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Statistics. I am interested in data science, competitive programming, procedural generation, cryptography, and cybersecurity. I plan to use this website as a place to post small writeups on projects I am working on.
I am actively looking for internships for Summer 2019. Feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn or email me.</description>
